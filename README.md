## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned
I hadn't used tables for a long time. I almost forgot about them. It was good to be able to use them again.




### Continued development

There are no direct points I want to focus on. HTML and CSS can have very broad focuses. I want to focus on everything. Practice makes perfect. The more hands on keyboard experience I get, the better. Works out better than just trying to remember a bunch of theory.
